I am a Computer Scientist and a full stack software developer experienced with advanced 
machine learning, algorithms and natural language processing. I love incorporating artificial intelligence algorithms into full stack software development.

<br>
I am a Master's Student in the Computer Science Department at University of Waterloo. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Graph based Semi Supervised Learning and Deep Learning. For my graduate thesis I am working on  Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, specifically on opinion mining on Github data. I work with [Professor Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/).
