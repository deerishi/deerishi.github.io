I am a Master's Student in the Computer Science Department at University of Waterloo. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Graph based Semi Supervised Learning and Deep Learning. My thesis is based on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, specifically on opnion mining on Github data. I work with [Professor Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/).

I graduated from BITS Pilani , Goa Campus in 2014 after which I  worked as a **Data Scientist** at [McGraw Hill Financial](https://www.spcapitaliq.com/). My work there was mostly on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrival. My main project at McGraw Hill Financial was designing an ***Information extraction system for the provision of financial intelligence***, for which we also filed a U.S Patent.
